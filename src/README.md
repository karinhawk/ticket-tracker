<p align="center"> An application built in React which allows employees to keep track of how many tickets they complete at work. The counter can increment and decrement (stopping at 0) the amount of tickets completed. New employees can be added using the form (accessed by clicking the plus button top left) and will appear in their own card at the bottom of the screen.
